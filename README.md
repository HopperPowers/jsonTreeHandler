# jsonTreeHandler
This javascript will parse a JSON string and output it into a &lt;ul> format

I only included the .js and .html files since everything else is probably irrelevant to what you need.

I included a function for click events, too. This will collapse nested elements on click if there are children, as well as boldface/italicize the clicked/collapsed parent.
